        <p>
          Don't worry I'll be short. <br /> <br />I am a French self-taught
          independant worker fond of learning new skills. I have worked in
          different environments and learned a lot in each and everyone of them
          as a marketing specialist more on this in the{" "}

          </NavLink>
          . <br />
          <br />
          Aside work, I spend most time learning new things, and coding was part
          of it! I started on basics like HTML & CSS. Then I added Javascript
          and React (now moving on to Python ðŸ«¡). I also tried multiple artforms
          in a digital and traditional manner : pencil, gouache, watercolor,
          sculpture, digital drawings on both Procreate and Photoshop for all
          matters related to drawing and painting. I also love traveling and
          taking pictures of places and wildlife I encounter (moutains are my
          favourite!).
