            The idea here is to share with friends a common database of what
            each of you has watched, read, visited and their thoughts on it. The
            "Keep in mind" function allows the user to keep track of what they
            want to watch/ read/ see later.

            The owner needed a new website as she developed her activity. With
            her permission I created this website to show her some ideas of what
            it could be.

            Working on this project was interesting to pull out logical
            frameworks and bring the output to users in a aesthetic design with
            dynamic content.
